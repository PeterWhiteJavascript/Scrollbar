You can add a scrollbar to any UI.Container that you want to be able to scroll to see all of the options.
This UI.Container must have a 'list' property that contains an array of text.

Features:

Click the arrows to move the list up/down.
Click the space between the bar and the top/bottom to 'jump' the list.
Drag the bar to scroll the list.

I'm not an artist, so the style is very basic.

Scrollbar made with Quintus HTML5 Game Engine by Peter White.

Feel free to use the code however you wish!
